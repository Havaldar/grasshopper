Done:
    set as sorted list functional correctness
    bst memory
    skew heap memory
    set as BST functional correctness

Priority:
    set as AAT functional correctness
    skew heap
    AVL tree without balanced property
    RB tree without balanced property
    quad tree

search tree / sets
    binary search tree
    red-black tree
    AVL tree
    AA tree
proving functional correctness of search tree requires reasoning about map (array property fragment ?)

heap:
    binary heap
    skew heap
    fibonacci heap
    leftist heap

space partition tree:
    quad tree   
    oct tree
    k-d tree
