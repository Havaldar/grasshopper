-------------------------
Required
-------------------------
- OCaml, version >= 3.12

- Z3, version >= 3.2, or

- CVC4, version >= 1.0

GRASShopper has been tested on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows/Cygwin.

-------------------------
Installation Instructions 
-------------------------
- Untar the distribution

- In the grasshopper directory, run 
     ./build.sh
  to produce native code compiled executables.

- Optional: run
     ./regression-tests
  to check whether the build succeeded.

-------------------------
Usage
-------------------------
- To run GRASShopper execute, e.g.
     ./grasshopper.native tests/spl/sl_reverse.spl
  The analyzer expects the Z3 (respectively, CVC4) executable in the path.

- To see the available command line options, run
     ./grasshopper.native -h

-------------------------
Emacs Modes
-------------------------
GRASShopper provides two emacs modes for GRASShopper programs:

- SPL mode: this mode provides syntax highlighting for the GRASShopper
  input programs (see tests/spl for examples), as well as on-the-fly
  checking and error reporting via flymake.

- GHP mode: this mode provides syntax highlighting for the intermediate 
  representation of programs inside GRASShopper. Such programs can be
  generated by running GRASShopper with the option 
      -dumpghp n
  Here, n=0,1,2,3 refers to the n-th simplification stage of
  verification condition generation.

To use the emacs modes, copy the files in the directory emacs-mode to
your site-lisp directory and add the following lines to your .emacs file:

(load "spl-mode")   
(load "ghp-mode")

To use the flymake mode with SPL programs, you need to put the
GRASShopper executable in the path and rename it to "grasshopper".

Optional: if you are using emacs 24.1 or newer, you may use the
flycheck mode as a replacement for flymake mode. In this case, also
copy the file flycheck.el into your site-lisp directory. We are using
a slightly modified version of the original flycheck mode by Sebastian
Wiesner.
