-------------------------
Emacs Modes
-------------------------
GRASShopper provides two emacs modes for syntax highlighting of programs:

- SPL mode: this mode provides syntax highlighting for the GRASShopper
  input programs (see tests/spl for examples).

- GHP mode: this mode provides syntax highlighting for the
  representation of programs inside GRASShopper. Such programs can be
  generated by running GRASShopper with the option 
      -dumpghp n
  Here, n=0,1,2,3 refers to the n-th simplification stage of
  verification condition generation.

To use the emacs modes, copy the files in the directory emacs-mode to
your site-lisp directory and add the following lines to your .emacs file:

(load "spl-mode")   
(load "ghp-mode")
